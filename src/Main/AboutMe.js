      </h3>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is Milad E-pour and I enjoy creating things that live on
        the internet. My interest in web development started back in 2015 when I
        decided to try editing websites using WordPress and Wix.
      </p>
      <p>
        My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and
        digital experiences at Upstatement for a variety of clients.
      </p>
      <p>Here are a few technologies Iâ€™ve been working with recently:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>JavaScript (ES6+)</li>
        <li>React</li>
        <li>Node.js</li>
        <li>WordPress</li>
        <li>MongoDB</li>
        <li>SQL</li>
      </ul>
    </>
  );
};

export default AboutMe;
